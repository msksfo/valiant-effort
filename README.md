# Valiant Effort

## Project Description

Valiant Effort is a website I created for a group of pilots and mechanics working on a vintage WW2 aircraft restoration project. They wanted the ability to blog about their progress along the way, so I decided to use Gatsby as the static site generator, Contentful as headless CMS, and Netlify for deployment. You can see the live site [here](https://valianteffort.netlify.com)

## Getting Started

-clone or download the repo
-cd into your project directory and install all project dependencies with npm install
-run npm start to start the development server
-the site is now live at http://localhost:8000
-optionally, open another browser window at http://Localhost:8000/__graphqL if you wish to experiment querying the data. You can learn more about this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)
